Provides read-only access to the information_schema.* views/tables in PostgreSQL

Requires dm-core

Be sure to set up a connection to the database you want to use (or use it in a project). The user must be the creator of the database or have been given proper access.

From the PostgreSQL Documentation:
"The information schema itself is a schema named information_schema. This schema automatically exists in all databases. The owner of this schema is the initial database user in the cluster, and that user naturally has all the privileges on this schema, including the ability to drop it (but the space savings achieved by that are minuscule)."

What can I use this for?
* Altering table constraints on the fly
* Altering user roles on the fly
